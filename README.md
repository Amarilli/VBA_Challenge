# VBA_Challenge

I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs:
- the ticker symbol,
- the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end,
- the percentage change,
- the total stock volume.

Furthermore, the script returns the stock with: 
- Greatest % increase,
- Greatest % decrease, 
- Greatest total volume.

I applied conditional formatting to the yearly change column and to the percent change column to highlight: 
- a positive outcome in green, 
- an adverse outcome in red.

Chat GPT helped me understand how to get the same routine on different worksheets.

AskBCS Learning and a tutor session assisted me in debugging my code.
